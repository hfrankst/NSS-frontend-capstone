# **Stock Up** Front-End Capstone Project


## Overview

Stock Up is an app to make grocery shopping easier and cheaper.  The purpose of this application is to provide grocery store product promotions in a simple and easily readable format.  

Feel free to fork or clone this project. Please note that this project uses Firebase to hold the grocery store promotions, and to save the promotions that users want to track. 

Also, the map is a [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin.

### Instructions

Stock Up is still in the development stage, so there are a few steps to go through before you can explore the app!  *Note: you will need Node Package Manager to complete installation.*

Be sure to ```npm install``` inside the ```~/lib/``` directory, once the project has been forked or cloned. 

Once all of the packages have been installed, launch your favorite browser and navigate to your local server!  

### Goals 

*To write an app that I would find immediately useful and practical
*Use AngularJS 
*Use a map to locate grocery stores
